The Journal Impact Factor of 2018, based on the Journal Citation Reports 2017 (JCR), have been released by [Clarivate Analytics](http://clarivate.com/?product=journal-citation-reports). 

You can check it on [Web of Science](https://www.webofknowledge.com/).

I sorted out some journals related to Remote Sensing, Geography, Hydrology, and Wetlands. You can download my sorted list HERE. Note that this is only my personal classification. My apologies if some of your preferred journals are not on the list here.

Keep in mind that journal impact factor is just one metrics, so donâ€™t take it too seriously!
